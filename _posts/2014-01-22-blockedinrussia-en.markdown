Today we with help of [Anton Nesterov](https://github.com/komachi) starts service [Blocked in Russia](https://blockedinrussia.org), which help journalists, researchers and activists check which websites is actualy blocked in Russia.

Principe of operation is very simple, we just try to load URL via different Russian ISPs and check if it was censored.

Due to some reasons (one of them is penalty for ISPs if they don't censor the internet), this service is private. If you want to get access, just [contact us](http://liberatetheweb.org/en/contacts) and we provide it to you free of cost.

Source code of this service [available on GitHub](https://github.com/liberatetheweb/blockedinrussia.org).
